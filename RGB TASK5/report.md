# FPGA-Based UART-Controlled Actuator System

A compact and effective project using the **VSDSquadron FPGA Mini** to receive serial (UART) commands and control **RGB LEDs** based on decoded inputs. This forms the foundation of actuator control via serial interfaces in automation or robotic systems.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates how an FPGA can be used to:
- Receive data via **UART**.
- Decode commands in real-time.
- Control actuators like **RGB LEDs** based on the received command.

The current implementation controls **two RGB LEDs** using the commands:
- `'r'` → Turns on red on both RGBs (with variations).
- `'g'` → Turns on green on RGB1 and blue on RGB2.
- `'b'` → Turns on blue on RGB1 and red on RGB2.

---

## Objectives

- Parse and interpret command protocols over UART.
- Control RGB LEDs (as actuators) based on UART inputs.
- Understand safe and reliable GPIO output control on an FPGA.

## System Requirements

### Hardware
- [x] **VSDSquadron FPGA Mini**

- [x] **Resistors (220Ω recommended)**
- [x] USB to UART module (if UART over USB not directly supported)

### Software
- [x] **Verilog HDL**
- [x] **openFPGALoader** or equivalent for programming
- [x] **Serial Terminal** (e.g., `minicom`, `PuTTY`, or `CoolTerm`)

##  System Architecture

```
+------------------+
| Serial Terminal  |
|   (e.g., PC)     |
+--------+---------+
        |
        | UART (115200 baud)
        |
+--------v---------+       +--------------------+
|  FPGA (VSDSquad) |<----->|  RGB LEDs (2x)     |
|                  |       |  (controlled pins) |
+------------------+       +--------------------+
```

## UART Command Protocol

| Command | RGB1 State | RGB2 State |
|---------|------------|------------|
| `'r'`   | Red        | Red        |
| `'g'`   | Green      | Green      |
| `'b'`   | Blue       | Blue       |

Ensure the character is **sent as ASCII** (e.g., not raw hex).

---

## Implementation Details

- Uses a **custom UART RX** implementation in Verilog.
- Internal clock of **12 MHz** configured via `SB_HFOSC`.
- RX state machine decodes each UART byte and sets LED states.
- LED control logic is synchronous with internal clock.

### Example Verilog Snippet:
```verilog
if (rx_data == "r") begin
  rgb_red      <= 1;
  rgb_green    <= 0;
  rgb_blue     <= 0;
  rgb2_red_r   <= 1;
  rgb2_green_r <= 0;
  rgb2_blue_r  <= 0;
end
```

## Future Improvements

- Extend to more actuators like motors or relays.
- Add UART TX for feedback.
- Implement command sequences or multiple byte protocols.

---

## Usage Instructions

1. Flash the bitstream onto the FPGA.
2. Open a serial terminal at **115200 baud, 8N1**.
3. Send ASCII characters: `'r'`, `'g'`, `'b'`.
4. Observe RGB LEDs changing color based on command.
