# 🔧 Verilog Implementation Report: Blue LED Blinking on VSDSquadron FPGA Mini

## 📌 Objective

To understand, document, and implement Verilog code that drives the **blue LED** on the **VSDSquadron FPGA Mini** using the **internal oscillator**, a **frequency counter**, and appropriate **pin mappings via a PCF file**.

## 🔍 Step 1: Understanding the Verilog Code

**🔗 GitHub Code**: [top.v - Verilog Code on GitHub](https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/blob/main/led_blue/top.v)

### 🔧 Module Ports

- input hw_clk: Hardware oscillator input  

- output led_red, led_green, led_blue: RGB LED outputs  

- output testwire: Debug/test output

### ⚙️ Key Components

- SB_HFOSC: Instantiates a high-frequency internal oscillator (~48 MHz)
- counter: 26-bit counter increments with every clock pulse

### 💡 LED Logic

assign led_blue = counter\[25\]; // Blinks blue LED based on MSB  
assign led_red = 0; // Red LED is always off  
assign led_green = 0; // Green LED is always off

Only the **blue LED** blinks. Red and green are **permanently off**.

## 📁 Step 2: PCF File and Pin Mapping

**🔗 PCF File**: [VSDSquadronFM.pcf on GitHub](https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/blob/main/led_blue/VSDSquadronFM.pcf)

### 📌 Pin Assignments

| Signal | FPGA Pin |
| --- | --- |
| led_red | 39  |
| led_blue | 40  |
| led_green | 41  |
| hw_clk | 20  |
| testwire | 17  |

These mappings align with the **VSDSquadron FPGA Mini** board specifications.

## 🛠 Step 3: Toolchain and Flashing

### ✅ Required Tools Installed

- yosys: Synthesizes the Verilog code
- nextpnr-ice40: Places and routes design
- icepack, icetime: Converts to binary and performs timing analysis
- iceprog: Flashes the .bin file to the FPGA board

### 🧪 Build & Flash Commands

make clean  
make build  
sudo make flash

Ensure: - FTDI USB connection is detected - USB passthrough is enabled for VMs

### ⚡ Outcome

- **Blue LED blinks** visibly on the board  

- **Timing report**: 6.29 ns (approx. 159.10 MHz max frequency)  

- Internal oscillator was used — no external crystal required

### ⏱ Blinking Rate Estimate

Given a ~48 MHz clock:

T = 2^25 / 48,000,000 ≈ 0.67 seconds

Thus, the **blue LED toggles once every ~0.67s**.
