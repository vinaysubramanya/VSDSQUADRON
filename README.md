# FPGA Task 1 - LED Blue Project

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a basic **LED control system** using the **VSDSquadron FPGA Mini** board. The project aims to control an LED using Verilog code and integrate it into an FPGA-based workflow. It showcases how Verilog programming can interact with hardware to drive outputs on an FPGA.

## Folder Structure

The folder structure for this project is organized as follows:


- `Makefile`: Automates the build and programming process for the FPGA.
- `README.md`: Contains details about the project, setup instructions, and requirements.
- `.pcf` files: Pin configuration files for setting up the FPGA board.
- `.v` files: Verilog HDL code for controlling the LED.

## Features

- **LED Control via FPGA**: The main functionality involves controlling an LED on the FPGA board through Verilog code.
- **PCF File**: Used for configuring pin assignments on the FPGA board.
- **Makefile**: Used for automating the process of building and programming the FPGA with the correct files.

## Tools Used

- **VSDSquadron FPGA Mini**: The FPGA board used for this project.
- **Verilog**: Hardware Description Language for coding the LED control logic.
- **Xilinx ISE** or **Vivado**: FPGA design tools for synthesizing and programming the FPGA.
- **Make**: Utility for automating the build process and compiling Verilog code.

## Requirements

- **VSDSquadron FPGA Mini** board
- **Verilog** development environment
- **Xilinx ISE** or **Vivado** for FPGA synthesis and programming
- **Make** utility for automation
