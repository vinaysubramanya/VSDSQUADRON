# 🔧 Verilog Implementation Report: Blue LED Blinking on VSDSquadron FPGA Mini

## 📌 Objective
To understand, document, and implement the Verilog code that drives the blue LED on the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini using the internal oscillator, a frequency counter, and appropriate pin mappings via the PCF file.

## 🔍 Step 1: Understanding the Verilog Code
**GitHub Link to Code**:  
[Verilog Code on GitHub](https://github.com/thesourcerer8/VSDSquadron_FM/blob/main/led_blue/top.v)

### Module Ports:
- **input hw_clk**: Hardware oscillator input.
- **output led_red, led_green, led_blue**: Outputs to control RGB LED.
- **output testwire**: Test output.

### Key Components in Code:
- **SB_HFOSC**: Instantiates a high-frequency internal oscillator (~48 MHz).
- **counter**: 26-bit counter that increments on each rising clock edge.

### LED logic:
```verilog
assign led_blue = counter[25]; // Blinks blue LED based on MSB
assign led_red = 0;
assign led_green = 0;
Only the blue LED blinks. Red and green are off.

📁 Step 2: PCF File and Pin Mapping

PCF File on GitHub

Pin Assignments:

Signal	FPGA Pin
led_red	39
led_blue	40
led_green	41
hw_clk	20
testwire	17
These pins correspond to the RGB LED and oscillator clock input as per the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini board's datasheet.

🛠 Step 3: Toolchain and Flashing
Required Tools Installed:
yosys: Synthesizes the Verilog code.

nextpnr-ice40: Places and routes design.

icepack, icetime: Converts to binary and checks timing.

iceprog: Flashes .bin file to the FPGA board.

Build & Flash Commands:
bash
Copy
Edit
make clean
make build
sudo make flash
Outcome:
Blue LED blinks visibly.

Timing report: 6.29 ns (159.10 MHz estimate).

Flashing was successful once FTDI USB connection was detected and VM USB passthrough was set correctly.

💡 Observations
Blinking pattern is based on counter[25], which toggles approximately once every 0.67 seconds (assuming ~48MHz clock).

The FPGA internal oscillator was successfully utilized without requiring external clocks.

testwire can be used for debugging or scope probing.
